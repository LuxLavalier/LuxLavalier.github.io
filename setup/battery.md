##### Charging the battery:

1. The battery may have a protective film or tape covering one or both of the contacts on the ends
   that should be removed before proceeding.

1. Your battery is very likely not fully-charged.
   Carefully note the charger and battery's correct direction, orientation, and polarity.

1. Insert the battery in to your charger and connect the charger to power.
   Your charger may plug in to a USB port or directly into a wall socket.

Congratulations! Your Lux Lavalier is now fully assembled! It will now automatically play a
playlist of pre-selected patterns endlessly (well, until the battery runs out and needs recharged).
